- 👋 Hi, I’m Carlos Martinez. I'm a full-stack software engineer passionate about using technology to connect people and foster community.
- 👀 I’m interested in fields intersecting with social networking, expanding access to new technologies, and machine learning, with a focus on enhancing equity for underrepresented communities and challenging discrimination in tech.
- 🌱 I’m currently honing my skills in Javascript, Python, and frameworks like Express, Mongoose, Django, and React. I'm always excited about learning new technologies and approaches that can help me better serve my communities. 
- 💞️ I’m looking to collaborate on projects that align with my passion for creating meaningful, user-centric applications, and that contribute to equity, accessibility, and education. I have a particular interest in educational technology, with a dream to create a global, decentralized educational platform leveraging advanced technologies.
